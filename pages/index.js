        Next.js is a JavaScript framework created by Zeit. It lets you build
        server-side rendering and static web applications using React. Itâ€™s a
        great tool to build your next website. It has many great features and
        advantages, which can make Nextjs your first option for building your
        next web application. You donâ€™t need any configuration of webpack or
        similar to start using Next.js. It comes with its configuration. All you
        need is to run npm run dev and start building your application ðŸ˜ƒ. In
        this article, we are going to explore the great features and tricks of
        Next.js, and how to start building your next website with it. This post
        assumes that you have some basic knowledge of React and JavaScript. Here
        are some great websites built with Next.js: Syntaxt.fm npmjs
        material-ui.io expo.io codemenitor.io I even used Nextjs to build my
        personal website saidhayani.me â€” you can get the source code on GitHub
        here. Getting starting with Next.js To start with Next.js you need to
        have node.js installed in your machine and thatâ€™s all. Next.js is like
        any other node.js application â€” you need npm or Yarn to install
        dependencies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Letâ€™s get started and create a Next.js project. First, we need to create
        a folder and give it a name of our choice. Iâ€™m gonna name it nextjs-app.
        You can easily do that with this command line: mkdir nextjs-app After
        creating the nextjs-app folder, open it on the terminal. Run npm init to
        create the package.json file. Next, we have to install our dependencies.
        Installing Next.js using Yarn, type yarn add next using npm, type: npm i
        next --save Then we have to install React because Next.js uses React.
        The first line below uses Yarn for the installation. yarn add react
        react-dom // with npm npm i react react-dom --save After that you have
        to create two necessary folders: pages and static . Next.js wonâ€™t work
        without them!! mkdir pages static You must have this structure after
        running these commands : nextjs-app -pages -static -package.json And
        then simply you can run npm next dev and then open
        http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. The NotFound page will show up
        because we dont have any page yet! So lets create a home page and an
        entry point index.js. touch index.js home.js And then you can write a
        normal React component. As I said above, Next.js is for building React
        applications. Here is what our home.js looks like: And here is our
        index.js file: Next.js has a live reload feature. All you need to do is
        just change and save, and Next.js will compile and reload the app
        automatically for you. Note: Next.js is like any other server-side
        rendering tool we need to define the default page of our application, in
        our case is index.js. You will see this change in the browser after
        running npm next dev: Congratulations! We just created a Next.js app
        with a few simple steps. These instructions to create a Next.js app are
        described in the official docs of Next.js .
      </p>

        My alternative I usually donâ€™t use this way. I use the create-next-app
        CLI instead that will do all this stuff for me in one single line. npx
        create-next-app my-app You can check out the documentation here to
        explore more features. Create custom configs for Next.js Sometimes you
        might want to add some additional dependencies or packages to your
        Next.js app. Next.js gives you the option to customize your
        configuration using a next-config.js file. For example, you might want
        to add sass support to your app. In this case you have to use the
        next-sass package and you have to add it to the next-config.js file as
        in the example below: First, install next-sass: yarn add @zeit/next-sass
        Then include it inside the next-config.js file: And then you can create
        write your sass code and import it in your component: Importing the sass
        file in our component: And here is the result: Wow, wasnâ€™t that super
        easy to add sass support to out Next.js app? At this point, we just
        covered the installation and configuration part. Now letâ€™s talk about
        the features of Next.js! The features Next.js comes with a bunch of
        great features like server-side rendering, routers, and lazy loading.
        Server-side rendering Next.js performs server-side rendering by default.
        This makes your application optimized for search engines. Also, you can
        integrate any middleware such as express.js or Hapi.js, and you can run
        any database such as MongoDB or MySQL. Speaking of search engine
        optimization, Next.js comes with a Head component that allows you to add
        and make dynamic meta tags. Itâ€™s my favorite feature â€” you can make
        custom and dynamic meta tags. These make your website able to be indexed
        by search engines like Google.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Here is an example of a Head component : And you can import and use
        theHead component in any other page: Awesome! Note: With Next.js you
        donâ€™t need to import React because Next.js does this for you. Generating
        a static website with Next.js As well as server-side rendering, you
        still can compile and export your application as an HTML static website
        and deploy it on a static website hosting like a GitHub page or netlify.
        You can learn more how to make a static website with Next.js here in the
        official docs. Routers This is another one of the great features of
        Next.js. When you use the create-react-app, you usually need to install
        react-router and create its custom configuration. Next.js comes with its
        own routers with zero configs. You donâ€™t need any extra configuration of
        your routers. Just create your page inside the pages folder and Next.js
        will take care of all routing configuration. Letâ€™s go ahead and create a
        custom navigation to make everything clear! To navigate between pages,
        Next.js has the Link method to manage the navigation. Letâ€™s create
        blog.js and contact.js pages: blog.js And here is the contact.js page:
        And now we must be able to navigate between those pages ðŸ˜ƒ Wow that so
        easy and super awesome. Lazy loading Lazy loading makes your application
        deliver a better user experience. Sometimes the page might take time to
        load. The user may abandon your app if the loading takes more than 30
        seconds. The way to avoid this is to use some trick to indicate to the
        user that the page is loading, for example by displaying a spinner. Lazy
        loading or code splitting is one of the features that allow you to deal
        with, and control, slow loading so you only load the necessary code in
        your page.
